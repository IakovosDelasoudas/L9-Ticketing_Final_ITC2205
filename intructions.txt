1.	Description of the topic, addressing the problem, the context, and the target market.

We decided, after a session with our clients, that their company needed to have a way to receive feedback for their
products. This led into proposing a ticketing system. The ticketing system will allow the company to receive direct input
from the consumers, whether that is questions about the products or general feedback on the products.

2.	Development language to be used (including justification)

We will use Java, since we are both familiar with the language and we feel confident that the required function of the
code will be much easier to develop. The software will include a menu that prompts the user with options.

3.	Objectives of the software to be developed
